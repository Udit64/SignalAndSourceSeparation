**Signal and Source Separation of Pop-Culture Music using Classical Machine Learning Techniques**

This project summarizes our efforts toward our course project for CSE-343: Machine
Learning at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi. We intend
to employ classical machine learning techniques for the task of signal and source
separation in pop-culture music tracks. In this paper, through extensive Exploratory
Data Analysis (EDA), we scrutinize the audio signals to extract and analyze their
inherent features. Drawing insights from various papers in the domain, our work
attempts to effectively utilize these techniques in isolating vocal and instrumental
components. By attempting and comparing methodologies, we provide a comprehensive
attempt at music source separation using classical machine learning
approaches.
